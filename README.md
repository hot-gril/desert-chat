# desert-chat
Read the design doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BORD3gDLjhp_MjSfiBAAVqthWbmlx__7iy-Il8MSCx0/edit?usp=sharing), mainly just the first page. It's short. \
Even shorter: Room-based, no server-side accounts, anyone can host a server, servers are super untrusted so you can just use random ones.

Despite the nerd talk, Desert Chat is primarily for average people to use. Not everyone cares about privacy, but it won't get in the way. The point is to beat Zoom and Zuck, in ways E2EE projects like Signal didn't, by succeeding on three fronts: privacy, openness, and ease-of-use. Our edge is that nobody has to set up accounts, and the rooms UX is kinda nifty.

WIP. Current implementation is text-only chat rooms with a lame CLI, but it exercises the basic design. Much more to come, like an actual GUI and video calls.

Why do we do this, cause we have a passion for messaging and passionately dislike the current state of it. \
