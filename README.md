# desert-chat
Read the design doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BORD3gDLjhp_MjSfiBAAVqthWbmlx__7iy-Il8MSCx0/edit?usp=sharing), mainly just the first page. It's short. \
Even shorter: No server-side accounts, anyone can host a server, servers are super untrusted so you can just use random ones.

Despite the nerd talk, Desert Chat is primarily for average people to use. Not everyone cares about privacy, but it won't get in the way. The point is to beat Zoom and Zuck by succeeding on three fronts: privacy, openness, and ease-of-use. Our edge is that nobody has to set up accounts.

WIP. Current implementation is text-only chat rooms with a lame CLI, but it exercises the basic design. Much more to come, like an actual GUI and video calls. Think of a room-based UI reminiscent of both Zoom and Whatsapp.

Why do we do this, cause we have a passion for messaging and passionately dislike the current state of it. \
