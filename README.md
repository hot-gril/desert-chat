# desert-chat
Desert Chat, easy and secure chat app with a uniquely open and simple design. \
Read the full design doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BORD3gDLjhp_MjSfiBAAVqthWbmlx__7iy-Il8MSCx0/edit?usp=sharing), mainly just the first page. It's short.

Despite the nerd talk, Desert Chat is primarily for average people to use. Not everyone cares about privacy, but it won't get in the way. Anonymity is not only for privacy but also usability, no dealing with accounts.

WIP. Current implementation is text-only chat rooms with a lame CLI, but it exercises the basic design. Much more to come, like an actual GUI and video calls. Think of a room-based UI reminiscent of both Zoom and Whatsapp.

Why do we do this, cause we have a passion for messaging and passionately dislike the current state of it. \
